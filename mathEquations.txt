            A = [a₍ij₎]  (i = row, j = column)
    Basic Operations
        Addition:
            (A + B)₍ij₎ = A₍ij₎ + B₍ij₎
        Scalar Multiplication:
            (cA)₍ij₎ = c · A₍ij₎
        Matrix Multiplication:
            (AB)₍ij₎ = ∑ₖ A₍ik₎ B₍kj₎
        Transpose:
            (Aᵀ)₍ij₎ = A₍ji₎
    Determinants
        2×2 Determinant:
            det(A) = a₁₁a₂₂ – a₁₂a₂₁
        3×3 Determinant (Sarrus):
            Write out and sum the products along the diagonals.
    Inverses
        2×2 Inverse:
            A⁻¹ = (1/det(A)) · [ [a₂₂, –a₁₂], [–a₂₁, a₁₁] ]
    Solving Systems
        Cramer’s Rule:
            For a system A·x = b,
            xᵢ = det(Aᵢ)/det(A),
            where Aᵢ is A with the i‑th column replaced by b.
    Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
        Characteristic Equation:
            det(A – λI) = 0
        Eigenvector Equation:
            A·v = λv
    Advanced Topics
        LU Decomposition, QR Decomposition, SVD:
            (Algorithms to decompose matrices; not a single equation.)
        Orthogonal Matrices:
            AᵀA = I
        Symmetric Matrices:
        A = Aᵀ

12. Discrete Mathematics
    Logic
        Logical AND/OR/NOT:
            A ∧ B, A ∨ B, ¬A
        De Morgan’s Laws:
            ¬(A ∧ B) = ¬A ∨ ¬B
            ¬(A ∨ B) = ¬A ∧ ¬B
    Set Theory
        Union:
            A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}
        Intersection:
            A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}
        Complement:
            Aᶜ = U \ A
        Cardinality:
            |A| (the number of elements in A)
    Complexity (Big O)
        Big O Notation:
            f(n) = O(g(n)) if ∃ c, n₀ such that f(n) ≤ c · g(n) for all n ≥ n₀
    Number Theory
        Division Algorithm:
            a = bq + r, 0 ≤ r < b
        Modular Arithmetic:
            a ≡ b (mod n)
            (Meaning n divides a – b)
        Prime Factorization:
            Every integer > 1 is the product of primes (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)
    Boolean Algebra
        Idempotent Laws:
            A ∧ A = A, A ∨ A = A
        Absorption Laws:
            A ∨ (A ∧ B) = A, A ∧ (A ∨ B) = A
    Base Conversion
        Decimal to Binary:
            Express N in base 10 as:
                N = dₙ2ⁿ + dₙ₋₁2ⁿ⁻¹ + … + d₀2⁰
                (Example: 13₁₀ = 1×2³ + 1×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 1101₂)
        Decimal to Octal:
            N = dₙ8ⁿ + … + d₀8⁰
            (Example: 83₁₀ = 1×8² + 2×8¹ + 3×8⁰ = 123₈)
        Decimal to Hexadecimal:
            N = dₙ16ⁿ + … + d₀16⁰
            (Example: 255₁₀ = FF₁₆)
        General Base Conversion:
            To convert a decimal number N to base b, repeatedly divide by b and record remainders.
